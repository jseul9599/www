                            production plans that respect people and the environment. We use field-centered 
                            environmental safety management to strive for “Zero” environmental safety 
                            accidents. This will help us to realize our vision of a workplace that is free 
                            of accidents, pollution, and illness. Moreover, we build and implement environmental 
                            and safety strategies based on the consensus among employees on the importance of 
                            environmental management.

                                The company recognizes HSE as its top priority, and therefore 
                                considers environmental safety above all else throughout the 
                                entire process of product design, production, use, and disposal.
                            </li>

                                All employees undergo regular HSE training so that they observe 
                                all laws, regulations, and other requirements. They also perform 
                                HSE activities that prevent environmental accidents.
                            </li>

                                The company will build an advanced HSE management system, and will 
                                establish a Process Safety Management (PSM) system that ensures the 
                                efficient use of resources and energy, prevents environmental pollution 
                                and accidents, and maintains clean and safe work environment.
                            </li>

                                The company will engage in dialogue with local residents, companies, 
                                and our customers and shareholders, so that we can fulfill our corporate 
                                social responsibilities through Responsible Care (RC) programs.

                                        We set a wastewater reduction target for each major source of wastewater 
                                        generation, and make improvements to processes that can reuse wastewater.

                                        from their arrival at our sites through to disposal. Hazardous chemicals used 
                                        in the workplace are strictly handled in production, purchase, and use. In addition,
