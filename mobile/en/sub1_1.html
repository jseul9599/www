                        Thank you for visiting the LOTTE Fine Chemical website.

                    <p>
                        Established in 1964, LOTTE Fine Chemical (LFC) has been keeping pace with 
                        the development of chemical industry in Korea since its founding. The company 
                        began in the general chemicals business, the foundation of the chemical industry, 
                        and then expanded into higher added value businesses, such as fine chemicals. 
                        These include AnyCoat®, a material for pharmaceutical capsules, and MECELLOSE®, 
                        a functional additive for construction. LFC also manufactures electronic materials, 
                        including tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAC), a material for semiconductors, and 
                        color laser printer toners. As such, LFC continues to expand its business areas and 
                        technological prowess as a specialty chemical company.
                    </p>

                        Economic fluctuations in Korea and abroad, including the international financial 
                        crisis, substantial domestic household debt, and a faltering manufacturing industry, 
                        have contributed to growing uncertainties in our business environment. Notwithstanding 
                        this, however, LFC has successfully completed its business restructuring, and improved 
                        internal efficiency, turning obstacles into opportunities. Leveraging the skills and 
                        experience built up over the last 50 years, LFC is now concentrating on bolstering its 
                        global competitiveness through innovation and creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the area of R&D, LFC is developing new uses for its products, and expanding research 
                        infrastructure to offer top-quality technology services to customers. We are also 
                        building world-leading production competitiveness while focusing on safety management. 
                        Our ‘creative partnership’, and the efforts of everyone at LFC to improve profitability 
                        and secure future growth drivers, are aimed at providing better products and services to 
                        all our customers.
